# Scanner-App
Made a simple QR code and Barcode Scanner with the help of Kotlin and Jetpack compose.

It will directly open the links through GOOGLE CHROME or to your default browser if GC is not available.
and if your QR code or Barcode is not a LINK then it will COPY the data to your CLIPBOARD of your keyboard.
